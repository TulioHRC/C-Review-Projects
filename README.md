# C-Review-Projects

This will be some simple C++ projects for me to review the language, and to prepare for my school subject. Will be only four simple projects, reviewing all the basic aspects of the language, that I know.

Obs.: I used CodeBlocks, so the folders will be a little confusing. Remembering **main.cpp is the code**.

Plan:

## C++ projects to review
### Basic project: Using comments, print and input.
The program will ask for a number and print this √number.
### Conditional project: Using IF, switch and “Operação ternária”.
The program will ask for a number between 1 and 5, using switch change this to other number, and then use “Operação ternária” to choose between 0 and 1.
### Iteration project: Using for and while.
Ask a number, and then show x “números primos” using for and while.
### Functions project: Using definition of functions.
Find the x “número primo” by order.
